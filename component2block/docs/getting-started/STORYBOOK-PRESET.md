# Storybook Preset

The `component2block` Storybook preset auto-injects all generated and authored style files into Storybook. No manual imports needed in `preview.ts`.

## Setup

Add the preset to your `.storybook/main.ts` addons:

```ts
// .storybook/main.ts
addons: [
  '@storybook/addon-docs',
  '../component2block/dist/preset.js',
],
```

## What It Injects

The preset reads `c2b.config.json`, derives file paths from `tokensPath`, and injects any that exist:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tokens.css` | CSS custom properties (generated) |
| `fonts.css` | @font-face declarations (generated, if fontFace defined) |
| `reset.scss` | Structural CSS reset (authored) |
| `content.scss` | Base typography — imports `_content-generated.scss` + behavioral rules (authored) |

All paths are derived from the `tokensPath` config value. If `tokensPath` is `src/styles/tokens.css`, the preset looks for `src/styles/fonts.css`, `src/styles/reset.scss`, and `src/styles/content.scss` in the same directory.

## How It Works

The preset uses Storybook's `previewAnnotations` API to return file paths for auto-import. Each file path becomes an import in the Storybook preview iframe, making the styles available to all stories.

Files that don't exist on disk are silently skipped — you only get what you've created. For example, if you haven't defined any `fontFace` entries in your config, `fonts.css` won't exist and the preset won't try to inject it.

## Verifying It Works

1. Start Storybook: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser dev tools on any story
3. Check that `tokens.css` variables are available on `:root`
4. Check that base typography from `_content-generated.scss` is applied to body and heading elements
5. Check that `@font-face` declarations from `fonts.css` are present (if you have font tokens)

## No Manual Imports Needed

With the preset configured, you do **not** need to import style files in `.storybook/preview.ts`. The preset handles all style injection automatically.

If you previously had manual imports like these in `preview.ts`, they can be removed:

```ts
// These are no longer needed — the preset handles them
// import '../src/styles/tokens.css';
// import '../src/styles/fonts.css';
// import '../src/styles/reset.scss';
// import '../src/styles/content.scss';
```
